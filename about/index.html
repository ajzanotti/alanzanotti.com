<p>
I've been professionally administering and developing on Linux systems since 2011.
</p>
<p>
The majority of my experience is with enterprise Linux and variants, namely Red Hat
and Oracle Linux. I've worked extensively with popular open source solutions such
as Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, and MySQL. I'm also familiar with several products
in the Oracle stack including Oracle Database and Oracle WebLogic.
</p>
<p>
Every organization is different, but I'm a strong proponent for the use of agile
methodologies. Now more than ever it's important for IT departments and development
teams to connect with their customers to deliver value. I believe in the benefits of
repeatable, measurable processes and leadership that doesn't lord over its employees.
Version control should be a staple in every environment and best practice should
be a reality and not a lofty ideal.
